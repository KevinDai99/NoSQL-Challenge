# NoSQL-Challenge

In this challenge, I demonstrate my ability to use MongoDB, a NoSQL database.

* I added a collection (a dataset) to my database called Establishments
* Though PyMongo and python I appended, updated, and converted data types my collection.
* Finally, I ran some queries to answer some basic questions such as:

1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue rating value of '5', sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?
